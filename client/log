For performance issues, it is highly recommended to use the *? quantifier instead of * in order to avoid greediness. This will avoid catching the last <h1> of the document: that's probably not what you want and that's not efficient as the regexp will continue to look for <h1> until the end of the string even if it has already found it before.

also known as the dotall modifier. 
It forces the dot . to also match newlines, which it does not do by default.
